# Cloud Native Technologies Workshop

## Description
The Cloud Native Technologies Workshop offers a unique and hands-on learning experience for participants who have completed the Cloud Native learning path. This workshop focuses on creating the backend infrastructure for a photo social network, incorporating key topics in storage, events, database, compute, networking, networking@edge, costs, and authentication. Participants, both teams and individual users, will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills in developing a cloud-native solution.

## Topics
The workshop consists of several sessions, where each session covers multiple interconnected topics that are essential for building the backend of a photo social network. Participants will have the chance to gain practical experience and deepen their understanding of cloud-native technologies within this specific context.

### Foundational Session
Introduction to Cloud Native Backend Development and Photo Upload with Thumbnail Generation
Overview of cloud-native backend architectures and design principles
Understanding the requirements and challenges of building a photo social network backend
Introduction to the topics covered in subsequent sessions
Hands-on Challenge: Participants will be guided to implement the functionality to upload photos to the photo social network service. Additionally, they will learn how to generate thumbnails for efficient display and user experience.


### Session 2:  Compute, Networking, and Networking@Edge

Leveraging containerization / serverless and orchestration technologies for efficient deployment and scalability
Designing and implementing networking components to enable seamless communication between users and the backend
Exploring networking@edge concepts to optimize content delivery and improve user experience


### Session 3: Costs and Authentication

Implementing cost optimization strategies to manage resources efficiently
Integrating authentication and identity management systems to ensure secure user access
Monitoring and analyzing costs while maintaining high performance and scalability
Throughout the workshop, participants will work collaboratively in teams, simulating a real-world development environment. By the end of the workshop, participants will have gained practical experience in building a cloud-native backend for a photo social network, incorporating various technologies and best practices in the cloud-native ecosystem.
